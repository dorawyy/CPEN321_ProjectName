# CPEN321_[ProjectName]

This repository is meant to serve as a general template for UBC CPEN321_V course project repositories. 

## Template Structure
The template repository is structured as follows:
* `.github/`: GitHub Actions workflows. You will need this at a later stage of the project.
* `backend/`: Backend code for the project.
* `frontend/`: Frontend code for the project.
* `docs/`: Documentation for the project.
* `.gitignore`: A file that tells Git which files to ignore.
* `README.md`: This file.
* `CHANGELOG.md`: A log of changes made to the project.
* `.eslintrc.json`: The configuration file for the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) tool, which you will need later for code review. 
* `checkstyle.xml`: The configuration file for the [CheckStyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) tool, which you will need later for code review. 
* `ruleset.xml`: The configuration file for the [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/) tool, which you will need later for code review. 

## Guidelines
* The `.gitkeep` files inside the folders are used to keep the folders in the repository. You can delete them once you add files to the folders.
* **Please make sure to keep these folders and files throughout your project.**  You can add additional folders and files as needed.
* You can decide how to structure your files within each of these folders. For example, in the `backend/` folder, you can have a `src/` folder for source code, a `test/` folder for tests, and a `config/` folder for configuration files, if any.
